BU CS 411 Group 45 Project

This is Team 45: Jon, Lili, Kelly, Bawoo

Our project Foodlib is a web application that utilizes Edamam's recipe search and nutrition analysis API to create recipes and provide nutritional data based on user inputs. Users can login to our app using their google account/ email, input different food items that they have in their kitchen to generate recipes and their necesary ingredients, and input ingredients to find out their nutritional data.
